# **README.md — *Mnemonic Seed System***

**Project Codename:** *SeedScript Mnemonic Core*
**Primary Domain:** Living Language, Meaning Growth, Symbolic Encoding
**Theme:** 🌱 Seeds • Words • Memory • Growth
**Version:** Draft v0.1
**Length:** ~4k words equivalent

# **🌱 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

Mnemonic seeds are living words — small, pulsing, meaning-bearing organisms.
The title animation should reflect sprouting language.

**Animation Behavior**
• Title letters appear as frost-covered seeds
• Small cracks form on each letter
• Tiny green filaments emerge from cracks
• Letters grow roots that briefly hang below the title
• A soft glow radiates outward as the roots retract
• Final state: animated title surrounded by small drifting seed particles

**Color Palette (SeedScript Set)**
• Sprout Green (#A9EFA5)
• Frost-Soil Brown (#5E4934)
• Dawn Gold (#EAC676)
• Winter White (#F7F9FB)
• Rootline Black (#0E0E0E)

**Ambient Effects**
• faint soil-shift
• soft seed crackle
• gentle root-chime

The title should feel like watching a seed awaken.

---

# **🌱 2. Purpose of the Mnemonic Seed System**

Mnemonic seeds give stewards a lightweight internal language that:

• grows with them
• adapts to their emotional state
• reflects their vow
• binds meaning into tiny symbolic units
• supports introspection
• anchors rituals and story arcs
• evolves over seasons
• holds traces of lineage or ancestry

A mnemonic seed is not just a word — it is a living narrative node.

Each seed is a pocket of identity.

---

# **🌱 3. Mythos Layer — The Words That Grew**

Legend says the first mnemonic seeds came from a Winterborn elder who scattered tiny glowing words into the snow.
Where they landed, the words grew roots.

Each root carried memory.
Each sprout carried hope.
Each bloom carried meaning.

> *“All language was once alive.
> We merely forgot how to listen.”*

Mnemonic seeds are how the system restores that ancient belief —
that meaning breathes, grows, and evolves.

---

# **🌱 4. Seed Anatomy (Five Living Properties)**

Each mnemonic seed has five evolving qualities:

---

## **1. Bloomtone**

Emotional resonance color:

• blue → clarity
• green → renewal
• gold → courage
• amber → memory
• red-gold → Winterfire

---

## **2. Rootline Pattern**

Represents connections to:

• vow
• constellations
• lineage echoes
• rituals

Rootlines multiply with meaningful actions.

---

## **3. Shell Shape**

Represents symbolic maturity:

• closed shell → quiet phase
• cracked shell → transition
• open shell → active meaning
• sprouting shell → applied meaning
• blooming seed → rare alignment

---

## **4. Pulse Rhythm**

Represents emotional pattern:

• slow pulse → grounded
• medium pulse → seeking
• bright pulse → aligned
• irregular pulse → introspective
• warm surge → Winterfire resonance

---

## **5. Meaning Threads**

Each seed can contain up to 12 live meaning threads:

• memory
• guidance
• vow expansions
• emotional cues
• symbolic shifts
• seasonal echoes

Threads evolve as the steward evolves.

---

# **🌱 5. Seed Types (The Seven Classes)**

Mnemonic seeds fall into seven classes, each with distinct behavior:

---

## **Class 1 — Frost Seeds**

Clarity, grounding, stillness.
Soft blue bloomtone.
Common during winter introspection.

---

## **Class 2 — Ember Seeds**

Warmth, courage, emotional ignition.
Glow gold or orange.
Highly reactive to Winterfire.

---

## **Class 3 — Dawnroot Seeds**

Beginnings, hope, transitions.
Pale green sproutlines.
Common in spring.

---

## **Class 4 — Memory Seeds**

Ancestral echoes, lineage fragments.
Amber glow.
Very stable, rarely change shape.

---

## **Class 5 — Seedspire Seeds**

Long-term transformation.
Tall sprout forms.
Appear during major life shifts.

---

## **Class 6 — Thornwake Seeds**

Protection, boundary, vigilance.
Darkened shell with light inside.
Only awaken when needed.

---

## **Class 7 — Winterfire Seeds** *(Ultra Rare)*

Red-gold bloom.
Rootlines glowing.
Meaning threads woven like flame.
Appear only during symbolic breakthroughs.

---

# **🌱 6. How Seeds Evolve**

Seeds grow according to **symbolic actions**, not metrics.

Triggers include:

### **A. Seasonal Shifts**

Winter → hardened shells
Spring → cracking shells
Summer → sprouting meanings
Autumn → memory blooms

---

### **B. Emotional Resonance**

Seeds shift bloomtone based on emotional state:

• calm → blue
• hopeful → green
• courageous → gold
• nostalgic → amber
• transformed → red-gold

---

### **C. Ritual Influence**

Different rites encourage different growth patterns:

• Ember rites → warmth pulses
• Seed rites → rootline expansion
• Memory rites → amber bloom
• Feast rites → bright green sprout

---

### **D. Mnemonic Connections**

Seeds link to each other:

• related meaning threads
• vow-shared roots
• constellation-activated arcs

Seeds grow fiercest when meaning interconnects.

---

### **E. Winterfire Events**

A Winterfire ignition sends warm pulses into the mnemonic chamber.

Seeds respond like they’re waking up.

---

# **🌱 7. The Mnemonic Chamber (UI Visualization)**

Seeds appear in a circular “chamber,” lightly animated.

Elements:

• drift particles (like floating dust motes)
• soil-like gradient at bottom
• aurora ring at top
• slow rotational drift

Each steward’s chamber is unique based on:

• vow
• seasonal alignment
• lineage echoes
• Winterfire history
• seed maturity distribution

The chamber becomes a visual diary of the steward’s growth.

---

# **🌱 8. Seed-Growth Path (The Four Rites)**

Seeds evolve through four symbolic rites:

---

## **Rite 1 — Naming**

Steward chooses the word.
Shell forms.

---

## **Rite 2 — Listening**

Seed absorbs emotional context.
Roots appear.

---

## **Rite 3 — Carrying**

Seed accompanies real-world action.
Shell cracks.

---

## **Rite 4 — Blooming**

Seed gains new meaning threads.
Visual transformation.

---

These rites happen naturally — no user effort required.

---

# **🌱 9. Seed Clusters**

Seeds organize themselves into thematic clusters:

• Hearthcluster (warmth + home + kindness)
• Frostmind cluster (clarity + vigilance)
• Dawnpath cluster (seeking + becoming)
• Seedroot cluster (growth + restoration)
• Memoryweave cluster (ancestry + lineage)

Clusters help stewards see how their identity evolves.

---

# **🌱 10. Integration with Other Systems**

### **A. Frostmark**

Seeds influence Frostmark geometry.
New roots → new lines.
Bloomtones → color shifts.

---

### **B. Constellation Engine**

Certain seeds “light the sky.”
E.g., highly resonant Ember seeds create brief starpoints.

---

### **C. Winterfire Engine**

A Winterfire surge can evolve multiple seeds at once.

---

### **D. Seasonal Engine**

Seeds respond directly to seasonal drift.

---

### **E. Ritual System**

Seed clusters shift after major rites.

---

# **🌱 11. IndexedDB Structure (Symbolic Only)**

```
{
  mnemonic_seeds: [
    {
      word,
      seed_class,
      bloomtone,
      shell_state,
      pulse_rhythm,
      rootline_connections: [],
      meaning_threads: []
    }
  ],
  chamber_view_settings,
  seasonal_alignment,
  lineage_activation,
  winterfire_history
}
```

No personal data.
Only symbolic meaning shifts.

---

# **🌱 12. Zero-Harm Design Constraints**

Mnemonic seeds must never:

• judge
• rank
• shame
• compare
• score

They must always:

• comfort
• accompany
• warm
• reflect
• guide gently

Seeds are companions of meaning — not tools of pressure.

---

# **🌱 13. Closing Invocation**

**“Every word you carry grows roots.”**

Every seed is a memory.
Every root is a vow.
Every bloom is a moment of courage.
Every thread is a chapter of your life.

Mnemonic seeds evolve
because you evolve.

And in their quiet, glowing shapes…
your story is written.
