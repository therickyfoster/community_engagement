# **🌿 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

Seed pathways are long arcs — the animation should feel like roots forming beneath snow.

**Animation Behavior**
• Title begins as scattered particles
• Lines appear beneath them like underground roots
• Paths slowly grow outward and upward
• Sprouts emerge and form the letters of the title
• Final state: the title standing like a living plant with animated rootlines

**Color Palette (Rootweave)**
• Deep Soil Brown (#48372A)
• Sproutline Green (#A6F2A2)
• Renewal Gold (#E3C477)
• Frost White (#F8FAF8)
• Path Black (#0E0F0F)

**Ambient Effects**
• soft earth-shift
• sprouting chime
• distant wind through grass

It should feel patient, alive, and quietly powerful.

# **🌿 2. Purpose of the Seed Pathways Engine**

A seed is a moment.
A ritual is a gesture.
A vow is a direction.
A season is a climate.

A **pathway** is:

• a pattern
• a direction over time
• a long-form arc
• a story beginning to take shape

The Seed Pathways Engine gently traces how small actions cluster into **symbolic paths**, without tracking frequency, metrics, or progress.

It is the system’s way of saying:

**“I see the direction your life is growing toward.”**

Not judging it.
Not quantifying it.
Simply witnessing.

---

# **🌿 3. Mythos Layer — “The Hidden Trails Beneath Us”**

In old Winterborn myth, it was said that beneath every forest lay a web of glowing paths.

When someone planted a seed or helped another, their footprints glowed briefly — and roots grew in their wake.

No one could see the full pattern until years later.

Spirits whispered:

> *“A life is not measured by steps,
> but by the direction its roots choose to grow.”*

The Pathways Engine is a digital reflection of this myth.

---

# **🌿 4. What a Pathway Actually Is**

A pathway is a **symbolic storyline** formed from:

• rituals
• mnemonic seed growth
• vow resonance
• lineage echoes
• seasonal shifts
• Frostmark changes
• Winterfire events

It’s not linear.
It’s not chronological.
It’s not numerical.

It’s a **pattern map**, showing the steward’s mythic arc.

---

# **🌿 5. The Seven Path Archetypes**

Every pathway forms around one or more of seven root archetypes.

---

## **1. The Path of Renewal**

Sprouting, restoring, beginning again.
Dominant in Spring.

## **2. The Path of Courage**

Warmth, effort, brave steps.
Dominant in Summer.

## **3. The Path of Memory**

Reckoning, understanding, integrating.
Dominant in Autumn.

## **4. The Path of Stillness**

Clarity, survival, reflection.
Dominant in Winter.

## **5. The Path of Kindling**

Small acts that ignite larger movements.
Triggered by Ember rites.

## **6. The Path of Guardianship**

Protection, stewardship, quiet strength.
Common in Winter + Autumn.

## **7. The Path of Restoration**

Repairing what was broken — life, land, or self.
Linked heavily to Seed Rites.

---

Most stewards have 2–4 active paths at once.
None are considered “better” — they are simply different life stories.

---

# **🌿 6. How Paths Form (Symbolic Logic)**

Paths emerge when repeated symbolic patterns appear in the steward’s arc:

### **A. Vow Echo Consistency**

If vow-root behavior recurs symbolically, it forms a pathline.

### **B. Seasonal Bias**

If seasons align with actions, paths stabilize.

### **C. Ritual Clusters**

If rituals of one family happen symbolically close together, a path blooms.

### **D. Seed Growth Patterns**

Sproutlines and roots cluster into path diagrams.

### **E. Frostmark Geometry**

Certain edge growth patterns suggest path direction.

### **F. Constellation Drift**

Arclines that repeat or resonate form sky-paths.

### **G. Lineage Echo Activation**

Strong lineage echoes create deeper, older paths.

This is not behavioral analytics —
it is mythic pattern recognition.

---

# **🌿 7. Path Visualization (The Underroot Map)**

The Pathways Engine renders paths under the main UI like glowing roots.

The Underroot Map includes:

• branching lines
• glowing nodes
• slow pulses
• seasonal color washes
• growing filaments
• dormant segments

Paths never imply:

• success
• failure
• progress
• regression

They simply show **what direction your symbolic life is moving.**

---

# **🌿 8. Path Growth Stages (Five States)**

## **State 1 — Flicker**

A faint line appears.
Usually seasonal or ritual-triggered.

## **State 2 — Tendril**

Line gains direction.
Sproutlines appear.

## **State 3 — Rootline**

Stronger filament.
Mnemonic seeds influence shape.

## **State 4 — Pathway**

Full pattern visible.
Constellation arcs mirror it.

## **State 5 — Lifeline (Rare)**

Represents long-term symbolic truth.
Not destiny — just clarity.

---

# **🌿 9. Seasonal Effects on Paths**

Paths change shape with seasons:

### Winter

Paths become narrow and crystalline.

### Spring

Paths branch and sprout filaments.

### Summer

Paths thicken and glow warmly.

### Autumn

Paths deepen and form amber cores.

This seasonal morphing helps the steward see emotional climate shifts.

---

# **🌿 10. Path + Other Engine Interactions**

### **A. Vow Engine**

Path shape follows vow arc.

### **B. Ritual Engine**

Specific rites influence path branching.

### **C. Mnemonic Seeds**

Seed clusters generate new path tendrils.

### **D. Frostmark**

Path alignments reflect Frostmark evolution.

### **E. Constellation Engine**

Sky-paths appear as star-arcs that mirror Underroot patterns.

### **F. Winterfire**

Winterfire surges cause momentary path illumination.

### **G. Lineage Engine**

Lineage echoes shape historical depth.

# **🌿 11. IndexedDB Structure (Symbolic Only)**

```
{
  active_paths: [
    {
      path_archetype,
      path_stage,
      path_shape,
      lineage_influence,
      vow_thread,
      seasonal_color,
      mnemonic_seed_links: [],
      ritual_echoes: [],
      frostmark_links: []
    }
  ],
  underroot_map_state,
  seasonal_flow_alignment,
  winterfire_path_illumination // transient
}
```

Only symbolic connections.
No timestamps, no metrics, no tracking.

---

# **🌿 12. Zero-Harm Pathway Constraints**

The Pathway system must never:

• imply progress or lack thereof
• reward or punish
• rank pathways
• tie identity to path
• pressure a steward into “choosing” a path
• suggest life purpose
• predict future behavior

It must always:

• affirm direction
• reveal gentle meaning
• illuminate emotional arcs
• provide clarity without pressure
• let the steward wander freely

Paths are possibilities, not mandates.

---

# **🌿 13. Closing Invocation**

**“Your life grows roots in the direction you walk.”**

Not because of fate.
Not because of destiny.
Not because you’re supposed to be anything.

But because every small act,
every kindness,
every ritual,
every moment of courage
extends one more filament into the soil of your becoming.

The Seed Pathways Engine makes visible
the quiet truth
that your life is growing
beautifully,
slowly,
meaningfully
toward something warm.
