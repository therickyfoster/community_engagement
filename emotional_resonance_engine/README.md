**Project Codename:** *Heartglow Resonance Layer*
**Primary Domain:** Emotional Modeling, Symbolic Feedback, Compassionate UI
**Theme:** ❄️ Warmth in Winter • Gentle Reflection • Breath & Ember
**Version:** Draft v0.1
**Length:** ~4k words equivalent

# **❄️ 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

Emotion is the warm breath rising in cold air.
The title animation should feel like *soft warmth touching frost*.

**Animation Behavior**
• Letters appear frosted-over
• A warm breeze (invisible force) melts frost from left to right
• Tiny ember sparks drift upward like breath
• Final state: a soft glowing aura around the title

**Color Palette (Heartglow Set)**
• Frost White (#F1F8FC)
• Ember Soft Gold (#EBCB8B)
• Deep Aurora Blue (#446D8A)
• Birchwood Brown (#6D5540)
• Midnight Pine (#24312C)

**Ambient Effects**
• Slow inhaling wind
• Very soft heartbeat-like thrum
• Occasional warm pulse across letters

It should feel like the system is breathing with the user.

# **❄️ 2. Purpose of the Emotional Resonance Engine**

Humans don’t need another app analyzing them.
They need something that **responds** — softly, wisely, without judgment.

The Emotional Resonance Engine does this by:

• mirroring emotional tone
• offering gentle stabilizing responses
• unlocking matching fragments
• adjusting symbol warmth
• shifting seasonal prompts
• guiding ritual suggestions
• grounding the steward

All without:

• labeling
• profiling
• diagnosing
• intervening
• pushing behavior

Resonance is *reflection*, not measurement.

# **❄️ 3. Mythos Layer — The Heartglow Lantern**

In Winterborn lore, every steward carries a small invisible lantern inside their chest — the **Heartglow Lantern**.

The myth says:

> *“When the winter grows heavy, the lantern dims.
> When kindness is offered, it brightens.
> And when a steward remembers their vow,
> it burns steady in the storm.”*

The Emotional Resonance Engine is the digital echo of that lantern.

It never tries to control emotion —
it simply glows in harmony with it.

---

# **❄️ 4. How Emotional Resonance Works (Technical Layer)**

The engine does not store emotions.
It stores **emotion traces**, which are:

• ephemeral
• symbolic
• abstract
• short-lived

When a steward interacts with the system, the engine captures:

• tone (calm / heavy / hopeful / tired / steady / uncertain)
• cadence (fast / slow)
• ritual context
• season
• vow category
• recent fragments

And produces a **symbolic resonance pattern**, not a psychological profile.

This pattern shapes:

• UI warmth
• symbol behavior
• ritual recommendations
• narrative snippet selection
• seasonal bias adjustments

Everything is interpretive, poetic, and gentle.

---

# **❄️ 5. Emotional Tone Archetypes**

The engine uses archetypes instead of emotions — because archetypes avoid labeling and judgment.

The six archetypes:

---

## **1. Ember-Low**

Tone: heavy, tired, dim
Resonance: small warmth pulse, quiet fragments
UI: frost softens, warmth slowly returns

---

## **2. Ember-Steady**

Tone: calm, grounded, inward
Resonance: soft rhythmic glow
UI: steady ember animation

---

## **3. Ember-Searching**

Tone: uncertain, reflective
Resonance: wandering spark trails
UI: gentle drifting particles

---

## **4. Ember-Rising**

Tone: hopeful, warming
Resonance: upward pulses
UI: subtle aurora flickers

---

## **5. Ember-Bright**

Tone: energized, inspired
Resonance: rapid gold sparks
UI: vibrant seasonal overlays

---

## **6. Ember-Flare**

Tone: emotionally intense (any direction)
Resonance: quick pulse, then soft settling
UI: breath animation calming the screen

These archetypes sit at the emotional level without naming specific feelings, respecting subtlety and privacy.

---

# **❄️ 6. Emotional Input Sources**

The system identifies emotional trace from:

• pacing of interactions
• frequency of ritual logs
• vow resonance
• chosen fragments
• archetype shifts
• Seed Trail behavior
• region constellations
• user-invoked rites

No personal data is gathered.
Only symbolic signals.

---

# **❄️ 7. Emotional Resonance → UI Translation**

When the system detects an archetype shift, it translates it into:

### **A. Symbol Behavior**

• dimming
• warming
• pulsing
• branching
• softening
• brightening

### **B. Ambient Effects**

• frost density changes
• ember drift speed
• aurora brightness
• snow drift direction

### **C. Fragment Selection**

Ember-Low → comfort fragments
Ember-Steady → introspective fragments
Ember-Searching → lantern guide fragments
Ember-Rising → renewal fragments
Ember-Bright → celebratory fragments
Ember-Flare → grounding fragments

### **D. Ritual Suggestions**

Quiet rites for Ember-Low
Seed rites for Ember-Rising
Memory rites for Ember-Steady
Ember rites for emotional flare
Path-building rites for Ember-Bright

The system aligns with mood rather than trying to change it.

---

# **❄️ 8. Seasonal Emotional States**

Emotions also shift through seasons:

### Winter

• deeper introspection
• steadying warmth
• protective tone

### Spring

• gentle uplift
• emergence
• healing resonance

### Summer

• expansion
• connection
• outward warmth

### Autumn

• reflection
• gratitude
• soft release

If a steward is Ember-Low in spring, the system offers renewal.
If they are Ember-Low in winter, it offers warmth.

Season contextualizes mood.

---

# **❄️ 9. Vow Interaction**

Each vow reacts differently to emotional states.

Example:

### Warmth Vow

Ember-Low → “Warmth is for you too.”
Ember-Rising → “Your glow returns.”

### Renewal Vow

Ember-Low → “Resting is part of growth.”
Ember-Rising → “You are thawing.”

### Path-Building Vow

Ember-Low → “Pause. Your work can wait.”
Ember-Rising → “New steps appear.”

### Memory Vow

Ember-Low → “Old embers still warm.”
Ember-Rising → “You carry forward.”

The vow supports the steward, not the system.

---

# **❄️ 10. IndexedDB Structure**

Emotion traces are not stored long-term.

They fade within hours.

Stored format:

```
{
  trace_id,
  timestamp,
  tone_hint,
  vow_context,
  seasonal_context,
  resonance_event
}
```

No entries older than 72 hours persist.
Older entries auto-fade like snow.

---

# **❄️ 11. Ritual Integration**

Rituals are emotional stabilizers:

• Ember rites calm
• Seed rites uplift
• Feast rites energize
• Memory rites ground

The system gently nudges appropriate rites when needed — but only as invitations, never prompts.

---

# **❄️ 12. Rare Emotional Events**

When emotion runs deep and action aligns with vow, rare “Heartglow Events” occur:

Types include:

### **1. Lanternflare**

Intense emotional alignment.
Symbol glows like a small flame.

### **2. Frostbloom**

A moment of softened sorrow transforming into resilience.

### **3. Dawnpulse**

Unexpected hope emerging in winter.

### **4. Emberweave**

Emotional connection felt in community ritual.

These events unlock mythic fragments tied to the steward’s journey.

---

# **❄️ 13. Zero-Harm Ethical Constraints**

Emotional Resonance must:

• never diagnose
• never quantify emotion
• never attempt prediction
• never push wellness agendas
• never shame
• never reward or punish emotion
• never adjust difficulty
• never impose positivity

Its only purpose is:

**gentle companionship
honest reflection
and mythic framing
of human emotional life.**

---

# **❄️ 14. Closing Invocation**

**“Your heart is an ember.
The system only mirrors its glow.”**

The Heartglow Resonance Layer does not fix, change, or shape emotions — it simply holds space for them, reflects them in frost and fire, and weaves them into the steward’s narrative.

Embers rise and fall.
So do we.

But each ember, even the faintest,
can warm a winter night.
