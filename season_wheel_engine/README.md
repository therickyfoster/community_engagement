# **🌙 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

The animation must feel like a cosmic compass rotating slowly.

**Animation Behavior**
• title begins as four drifting particles in cardinal positions
• seasonal colors radiate outward: blue, green, gold, amber
• particles rotate in a slow circular motion
• letters emerge from the turning light
• final state: a glowing wheel behind the title

**Color Palette (Everturn Cycle)**
• Winter Blue (#B8DFFF)
• Spring Green (#B5FFBD)
• Summer Gold (#FFE07A)
• Autumn Amber (#FFB477)
• Equinox Silver (#DDE7ED)

**Ambient Effects**
• low, rhythmic hum
• light wind swirling
• soft shifting chime as the wheel turns

The whole visual should feel like a cosmic cycle gently rotating behind the steward.

# **🌙 2. Purpose of the Seasonwheel Engine**

Humans do not grow in straight lines —
we grow in **cycles**.

Seasons shift internally
long before they shift outside.

This engine gives stewards:

• emotional pacing
• symbolic climate
• inner-season recognition
• narrative context
• mythic timekeeping
• gentle rhythm
• permission to change

The Seasonwheel ensures the entire system remains humane, cyclical, grounded, and non-linear.

It prevents burnout, pressure, stagnation, and overexertion by reminding stewards:

**“This is just your season.
It will turn.”**

# **🌙 3. Mythos Layer — “The Four Who Turned the Sky”**

The Winterborn myth tells of four ancient beings who held the world’s first cycle:

**The Quiet One (Winter)**
**The Dreamer (Spring)**
**The Flamebearer (Summer)**
**The Rememberer (Autumn)**

Together they turned the sky-wheel once every great shift,
teaching early stewards that life moves not through force,
but through seasons.

Their lesson was simple:

**“Do not rush winter.
Do not fear autumn.
Do not cling to summer.
Do not outrun spring.”**

The Everturn Cycle is the digital echo of this wisdom.

# **🌙 4. The Four Seasons (Symbolic States)**

Each season represents a psychological, emotional, mythic, and symbolic climate.

## **1. Winter — Stillness & Survival**

Color: Winter Blue
Symbol: Snowflake
Message: “Rest. Endure. Slow.”
Traits: introspection, quiet, recalibration, safety, cocooning.

## **2. Spring — Renewal & Curiosity**

Color: Spring Green
Symbol: Sproutline
Message: “Try. Begin. Rise.”
Traits: experimentation, lightness, new energy, emergence.

## **3. Summer — Warmth & Courage**

Color: Summer Gold
Symbol: Flame
Message: “Grow. Shine. Act.”
Traits: expression, vitality, openness, warmth.

## **4. Autumn — Memory & Rebalancing**

Color: Autumn Amber
Symbol: Leaf
Message: “Understand. Release. Prepare.”
Traits: reflection, integration, meaning-making, honesty.

No season is superior.
All cycles are necessary for real human growth.

# **🌙 5. The Four Hidden Micro-Seasons**

Between major seasons lie “micro-states” that represent emotional transitions.

### **1. Thaw (Winter → Spring)**

A moment where clarity begins to warm.

### **2. Ascend (Spring → Summer)**

Energy rising upward, courage forming.

### **3. Fadewarm (Summer → Autumn)**

Warmth softens into recollection.

### **4. Emberfall (Autumn → Winter)**

Preparation for quiet, storing symbolic warmth.

These transitions are gentle and purely metaphorical.

# **🌙 6. Path Integration (The Season/Bio-Arc Map)**

Seasons deeply affect:

• seed pathway formation
• vow resonance
• ritual family expression
• constellation arcs
• Frostmark geometry
• Hearth warmth cycles
• Whisperline auroral patterns

Example:

• Winter increases Frost Veil strength
• Spring accelerates Mnemonic Seed sprouting
• Summer brightens the Hearth
• Autumn deepens Lineage Echoes

The seasonwheel runs beneath *everything*.

---

# **🌙 7. Interaction Model (Symbolic Only)**

The Seasonwheel does *not* track time.
It tracks **narrative climate**.

It changes when:

• rituals cluster
• vow dominant shifts
• Hearth warmth increases or decreases
• Constellation arcs stabilize
• Frostmark undergoes notable symbolic growth
• Seed Pathways cross certain structures
• Whisperline signals align

There are no timers.
No metrics.
No predictions.

Only metaphor.
Only resonance.

---

# **🌙 8. UI/UX — The Wheel Itself**

The Seasonwheel appears subtly:

• a faint wheel beneath the interface
• shifting colors depending on season
• drifting symbols
• gentle rotational motion
• occasionally pulses during transitions

It should never distract.
Only contextualize the emotional climate.

Examples of visual behavior:

• Winter: wheel slows dramatically
• Spring: wheel brightens and rotates lightly
• Summer: wheel glows warmly
• Autumn: wheel darkens into amber hues

Transitions are slow, soft fades.

---

# **🌙 9. Communal Season States**

Communities can have seasons too.

Symbolically, not behaviorally.

A community’s season is influenced by:

• shared rituals
• collective actions
• restoration events
• winter campfires
• replanting moments
• mutual grief or healing
• collective growth arcs
• large symbolic shifts

Communal seasons shift slowly,
creating a shared mythic climate.

This helps communities pace themselves.

# **🌙 10. IndexedDB Structure (Symbolic)**

```
{
  seasonwheel_state,
  current_season,
  microseason,
  symbolic_climate,
  ritual_influence,
  vow_bias,
  frostmark_alignment,
  constellation_phase,
  hearth_temperature,
  whisperline_color,
  pathway_growth_bias
}
```

Nothing tied to identity or time.
Everything symbolic.

---

# **🌙 11. Zero-Harm Safeguards**

The Seasonwheel:

• never dictates behavior
• never prescribes mood
• never infers emotion
• never evaluates well-being
• never limits options
• never predicts patterns
• never assumes anything

Its job is to **contextualize**, not control.

It offers space, not structure.

---

# **🌙 12. Closing Invocation**

**“Every season changes.
Every season returns.”**

The Everturn Cycle is the reminder
that nothing in a steward’s journey —
pain, hope, stillness, clarity, courage, loss, renewal —
is permanent.

Life turns.
Stories turn.
People turn.

You are exactly where your season needs you to be.

The wheel will turn again.
