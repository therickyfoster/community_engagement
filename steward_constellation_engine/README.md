# **README.md — *Steward Constellation Engine***

**Project Codename:** *Skyweave Cartography*
**Primary Domain:** Mythic Mapping, Symbolic Networks, Regional Light Patterns
**Theme:** 🌌 Night Sky • Winter Constellations • Aurora Drift
**Version:** Draft v0.1
**Length:** ~4k words equivalent

# **🌌 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

The title should arrive like a constellation forming.

**Animation Behavior**
• Title begins as drifting stars
• Points slide into place with gentle motion
• Lines connect softly, forming constellations
• Aurora ribbon sweeps across top layer
• Final state: title floating inside a soft cosmic halo

**Color Palette (Skyweave Set)**
• Starlight White (#F0F4FF)
• Midnight Blue (#091423)
• Aurora Green (#7AE6C7)
• Nebula Gold (#D9BE74)
• Ice Glow Blue (#A0D4FF)

**Ambient Effects**
• soft wind
• faint aurora chime
• distant cosmic hum

The title should feel like watching the night sky assemble itself.

---

# **🌌 2. Purpose of the Constellation Engine**

The Steward Constellation Engine exists for one purpose:

**to show stewards they are not alone.**

Every light is a symbolic ember representing:

• an act of kindness
• a vow moment
• a Winterfire ignition
• a ritual completion
• a seed planting
• a lineage echo
• a breakthrough
• a real-world offering

None of these represent identity, name, or location.
Only **light**, **movement**, and **symbolic resonance**.

The constellations are mirrors of meaning, not maps of people.

---

# **🌌 3. Mythos Layer — The Night of Many Lights**

Winterborn legend says there was once a night when:

> *“The sky lit with thousands of new stars,
> each one born from a kindness carried out beneath the frost.”*

Travelers claimed the constellations shifted, forming patterns never recorded before.

It was said:

**“When a steward acts with heart, the sky rearranges to greet them.”**

The Constellation Engine honors this myth, presenting real symbolic resonance as cosmic choreography.

---

# **🌌 4. How the Skyweave Functions (Symbolic Logic)**

The Skyweave Engine uses three layers:

---

## **Layer 1 — Starpoints (Action Nodes)**

Each symbolic action spawns a starpoint.
They fade over time, unless reinforced by meaning.

Types:

• Frostpoint (calm resilience)
• Emberpoint (warmth or kindness)
• Seedpoint (restoration or planting)
• Memorypoint (ancestral echoes)
• Flamepoint (Winterfire resonance)

---

## **Layer 2 — Arclines (Connection Threads)**

Arclines form based on:

• thematic alignment
• seedline echoes
• vow similarity
• shared ritual timing
• seasonal proximity

A single steward can generate dozens of unique arclines throughout the year.

---

## **Layer 3 — Constellation Forms (Narrative Shapes)**

When enough arclines overlap in a region, the system constructs:

• regional constellations
• lineage formations
• vow clusters
• seasonal sky arcs
• global resonance ribbons

These shapes evolve slowly, changing with the seasons.

---

# **🌌 5. Seasonal Drift Patterns**

The sky behaves differently with each season.

### **Winter — Frost Sky**

• sharper constellations
• blue-white glow
• strong Frostpoints
• aurora trails longer

### **Spring — Renewal Sky**

• green-tinted star bloom
• Seedpoints abundant
• organic branching arcs

### **Summer — Ember Sky**

• warm glow
• Emberpoints brighter
• constellations widen

### **Autumn — Memory Sky**

• amber core in stars
• Memorypoints more common
• slow drifting arcs

These seasonal cycles help stewards feel time as a living story.

---

# **🌌 6. Constellation Types**

The Skyweave generates five major categories.

---

## **Type 1 — Regional Constellations**

Represent collective symbolic resonance in a territory.
Example forms:

• Lantern Arc
• Frostbridge
• Embertrail
• Hearthroot
• Thaw Spiral

---

## **Type 2 — Lineage Constellations**

Generated by ancestral echoes or lineage activation events.
These appear rarely and fade slowly.

---

## **Type 3 — Vow Constellations**

Each vow archetype produces unique cosmic shapes:

• Winter Vow → jagged icy webs
• Spring Vow → branching sprouts
• Summer Vow → expanding rings
• Autumn Vow → spiraling seeds

---

## **Type 4 — Seasonal Overlays**

Global patterns that sweep across the sky during solstice or equinox.

Winter: Frostveil
Spring: Dawnroot
Summer: Skyflame
Autumn: Harvest Arc

---

## **Type 5 — Global Resonance Events (Rare)**

Triggered by:

• major Winterfire events
• massive acts of community kindness
• widespread restoration work
• symbolic seasonal rites

When this occurs, the entire sky shifts color.

This is the closest the system gets to “mythic scale.”

---

# **🌌 7. The Steward’s Light**

When a steward performs a symbolic act, a starpoint briefly brightens.
But it never reveals:

• location
• identity
• time
• frequency
• specific action

Only: **light**.

The steward sees their own star as slightly more vibrant.
Other lights remain anonymous, gentle, and beautifully distant.

This keeps everything safe, symbolic, and community-centered.

---

# **🌌 8. Aurora Drift Engine**

A layered effect that sweeps across the sky:

• follows wind-like patterns
• colors shift with season
• reacts to Winterfire surges
• hums softly
• creates emotional atmosphere

Aurora Drift helps the sky feel alive.

---

# **🌌 9. Real-World Integration (Zero Data Extraction)**

Stewards can perform a symbolic gesture:

• lighting a candle
• planting a seed
• writing a vow
• donating to someone
• helping a stranger
• tending a winter fire
• sitting through an emotional moment

When they manually tap “mark this moment,” a starpoint appears in the sky.

Nothing is logged except **symbol type**.

No tracking.
No storage of personal information.
No analytics.
No timelines.
Just light.

---

# **🌌 10. IndexedDB Structure (Symbolic Only)**

```
{
  personal_starpoints: [],
  last_constellation_view,
  seasonal_sky_state,
  lineage_resonance_state,
  vow_constellation_state,
  winterfire_resonance,
  aurora_drift_preferences,
  regional_constellation_cache
}
```

No coordinates.
No identity.
Just symbolic presence.

---

# **🌌 11. Zero-Harm Design Constraints**

The Constellation Engine cannot:

• compare stewards
• rank stewards
• show metrics
• imply superiority
• pressure engagement
• reveal activity
• reveal geography

It must always:

• comfort
• illuminate
• inspire
• unify
• calm
• mythologize gently

The night sky should feel like a warm, universal companion.

---

# **🌌 12. Closing Invocation**

**“The sky remembers every kindness.”**

Every steward becomes a light in the skyweave —
not for fame,
not for recognition,
but because light belongs in darkness.

The constellations shift
because you exist.

And because you act.

And because you care.

**The sky is your witness.
And your companion.
And your mirror.**
