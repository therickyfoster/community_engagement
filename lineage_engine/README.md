**Version:** Draft v0.1
**Length:** ~4k+ words equivalent

# **🜁 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

Lineage is soft, subtle, ancient.
The animation should feel like memory rising from snow.

**Animation Behavior**
• Title appears as faint etchings under frost
• Warm amber lines slowly melt the frost
• Runes pulse beneath the surface
• A spiral pattern glows behind the title
• A rising aurora thread forms the underline

**Color Palette (Ancestrel Set)**
• Amber Memory (#CFA16B)
• Old Ice (#CFD8E1)
• Deep Root Brown (#4A332A)
• Pale Dawn (#F3EFE8)
• Lineage Gold (#E7C78F)

**Ambient Effects**
• faint memory-chime
• soft whisper
• distant wind through dry branches

The title should feel ancient, warm, and quietly powerful.

---

# **🜁 2. Purpose of the Lineage Engine**

This engine exists to give the steward **context**, not identity.

It gently communicates:

• where your symbolic patterns come from
• what emotional echoes you carry
• how your roots spread into the past
• how your story fits into a larger tapestry
• how ancestral strength flows into you

The lineage engine never defines you.
It simply shows the **threads behind you**.

---

# **🜁 3. Mythos Layer — “Threads Beneath the Snow”**

Legend says that under every winter field lie thousands of frozen roots, each connected to someone who lived before.

In ancient lore, these roots glowed faint gold during certain nights —
whenever a descendant acted in alignment with their deeper nature.

Spirits whispered:

> *“One life is a torch carried by many.”*

The Lineage Engine is the digital/mythic reflection of that ancient belief.

---

# **🜁 4. What Lineage Actually Means in Winterborn**

Lineage in this system is **symbolic**, not genealogical.
It is not about:

• family tree
• bloodline
• genetics
• ancestry.com
• cultural obligation

Lineage refers to:

• emotional inheritance
• moral inheritance
• symbolic inheritance
• archetypal inheritance
• mythic resonance
• inner patterns you carry
• internal stories that shaped you

It is the “story-soil” you grew from.

# **🜁 5. Lineage Echo Types (The Seven Echo Families)**

Each steward carries echoes from seven mythic families:

---

## **1. Hearth Echo**

Warmth, protection, family memory.

## **2. Frost Echo**

Survival, clarity, resilience.

## **3. Ember Echo**

Courage, truth, self-sacrifice.

## **4. Root Echo**

Growth, repair, restoration.

## **5. Sky Echo**

Imagination, myth, vision.

## **6. River Echo**

Change, emotion, flow.

## **7. Stone Echo**

Endurance, grounding, legacy.

---

Stewards usually have 2–3 strong echoes, not all seven.

---

# **🜁 6. The Lineage Spiral (UI Visualization)**

The Lineage Spiral is a rotating circular interface of threads:

• each thread = one echo
• glow intensity = resonance, NOT measurement
• amber pulses = memory rites
• soft green pulses = seed rites
• gold pulses = Ember rites
• blue pulses = frost rites

The spiral moves slowly, never urgently.

It should feel like watching a time-lapse of roots growing beneath ice.

---

# **🜁 7. How Lineage Echoes Influence Other Systems**

### **A. Frostmark**

Certain lineage echoes warp frost-line geometry:

• Hearth → rounded edges
• Frost → sharper crystalline nodes
• Ember → subtle vein flare
• Root → branching filaments
• Sky → constellation-like specks
• River → wavy edges
• Stone → thickened core

---

### **B. Mnemonic Seeds**

Lineage influences:

• thread density
• sprout curves
• amber bloom patterns

---

### **C. Ritual Engine**

Some rituals feel naturally resonant depending on lineage echo.

---

### **D. Vow Engine**

Lineage echoes do not dictate vow —
but they influence **how** the vow expresses.

---

### **E. Constellation Engine**

Certain starpoint arcs reflect lineage patterns.
River lineage → ribbon-like arcs
Stone lineage → rigid arcs
Sky lineage → scattered arcs
Root lineage → branching arcs

---

### **F. Winterfire**

Certain echoes amplify Winterfire stability.

---

# **🜁 8. Lineage Evolution (Three Phases)**

Lineage does not “grow” like vows or seeds.
It **clarifies**.

---

## **Phase 1 — Mist**

Echoes are faint, unclear.
Steward is still discovering themselves.

---

## **Phase 2 — Thread**

Echoes become visible patterns in rituals, seeds, and Frostmark.

---

## **Phase 3 — Spiral**

Echoes harmonize.
The steward feels more grounded in their place in the myth.

This is not hierarchy.
Just clarity.

---

# **🜁 9. Lineage and Beacons**

The Lineage Engine harmonizes beacon effects.

• Streamer Beacon → activates Sky Echo
• Sommerset Beacon → activates River Echo
• Guardian Beacon (future) → activates Ember Echo
• Steward Beacon → activates Hearth Echo

These effects remain symbolic and emotional — not predictive, not deterministic.

---

# **🜁 10. IndexedDB Structure (Symbolic Only)**

```
{
  lineage_echoes: {
    hearth: 0-3,
    frost: 0-3,
    ember: 0-3,
    root: 0-3,
    sky: 0-3,
    river: 0-3,
    stone: 0-3
  },
  lineage_phase,
  lineage_spiral_state,
  lineage_ritual_history: [],
  seasonal_alignment,
  vow_resonance_trace
}
```

All values are symbolic, not numerical metrics.
(e.g., 0 = faint echo, 3 = strong echo)

No personal or family data ever stored.

---

# **🜁 11. Zero-Harm Lineage Rules**

Lineage must never:

• dictate identity
• suggest fate
• imply limitations
• create pressure
• create comparison
• influence real-world genealogy
• manipulate emotion

Lineage must always:

• affirm
• contextualize
• soothe
• empower
• clarify meaning
• connect without binding

The Lineage Engine is a mirror — not a map.

---

# **🜁 12. Closing Invocation**

**“Your story begins long before you were born.”**

Not because of blood
or lineage charts
or genetics
but because you carry echoes of
every kindness,
every hardship,
every myth,
every dream
that shaped the world you entered.

The Lineage Engine helps you remember:
you are not alone,
not rootless,
not unconnected.

Your roots run deeper than memory
and farther than snow.
