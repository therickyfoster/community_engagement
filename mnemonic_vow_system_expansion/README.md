# **❄️ 1. Animated Title Schema (Design Notes)**

Vows are ancient.
Not spoken loudly — whispered, breathed, etched into winter air.
The title animation reflects the solemn magic of vow-binding:

**Animation Behavior**
• Letters appear as carved runes under frost
• A warm glow slowly fills each rune from within
• Thin vapor breath rises from the edges (cold-air effect)
• After warming, the vow-sigil gives a gentle pulse

**Color Palette (Oathroot Theme)**
• Frost Rune White (#F3F8FB)
• Oath Ember Gold (#E7C47C)
• Shadow Pine Green (#2C3A32)
• Winter Iron (#4D5256)
• Hearth Brown (#614C3F)

**Ambient Effects**
• Frost crackle sound on reveal
• Vapor plumes drifting upward
• Occasional “ember drift” across screen

Vows should visually feel like something older than language.

# **❄️ 2. Purpose of the Mnemonic Vow System**

The Oathroot Engine is the **identity core** of a steward.
A vow is not a rule, requirement, or demand — it is a **commitment of spirit**, something the steward chooses freely that subtly shapes:

• narrative unlocks
• symbol evolution
• seasonal behavior
• ritual invitations
• Seed Trail resonance
• real-world action emphasis

The vow becomes the “root word” of the steward’s mnemonic.
Each word in the mnemonic gains meaning as seasons turn.

The vow is not a badge.
It is a direction of the heart.

---

# **❄️ 3. Mythos Layer — The Oathroots**

In the Winterborn myth, the first stewards carved their vows into living roots beneath ancient pines.
Their breath carried frost into those roots.
Their words warmed the earth above them.

These vow-roots became known as **Oathroots**, believed to:

• bind winter spirits
• protect villages
• carry warmth between distant travelers
• awaken sleeping seeds
• remind the earth of human kindness

The lore says:

> *“A vow carried through winter becomes an oath carried through life.”*

The Oathroot Mnemonic Vow Engine brings this ancient idea into modern form.

---

# **❄️ 4. Vow Categories (The Four Pillars)**

Vows fall into four categories, each tied to a season, archetype, and symbolic function.

---

## **❄️ Winter Vows — Warmth & Protection**

Focus: endurance, compassion, guarding others.
Vow examples:

• *“I will leave no one out in the cold.”*
• *“Where there is fear, I will be a lantern.”*
• *“Warmth shared is warmth multiplied.”*

Internal theme: protection.

---

## **🌱 Spring Vows — Renewal & Planting**

Focus: healing, growth, tending to life.
Examples:

• *“I plant where others have forgotten.”*
• *“I warm the earth for new beginnings.”*
• *“I mend the small wounds of the world.”*

Internal theme: renewal.

---

## **🔥 Summer Vows — Action & Building**

Focus: community structure, repair, generosity.
Examples:

• *“I build what can shelter others.”*
• *“My steps create paths for those who follow.”*
• *“I work so others can rest.”*

Internal theme: creation.

---

## **🍂 Autumn Vows — Memory & Wisdom**

Focus: reflection, preservation, gratitude.
Examples:

• *“I remember the warmth given to me.”*
• *“I gather stories so none are lost.”*
• *“I prepare the hearth for colder days.”*

Internal theme: continuity.

# **❄️ 5. Mnemonic Generation (Technical Layer)**

The mnemonic consists of 12 words selected from:

• vow-root lexicon
• seasonal lexicons
• emotional archetype lexicons
• ecological lexicons
• ancient winter lore lexicons

The mnemonic is:

• offline
• user-owned
• un-synced
• derivation of vow + random entropy

It is not a password.
It is a **sacred phrase of identity**.

Example (fragments, not actual outputs):

*lantern frost willow quiet hearth ember path shelter silver dawn pine breath*

Each word contributes to long-term narrative and symbol behavior.

---

# **❄️ 6. Vow-to-Mnemonic Mapping Logic**

When a steward chooses their vow:

1. The system selects a “root word” representing the vow.
2. It anchors the mnemonic entropy to that root.
3. It biases other words toward complementary symbolism.
4. Seasonal bias adjusts thematic tones.

If vow = Winter → bias toward:

• ember
• frost
• lantern
• shelter

If vow = Spring → bias toward:

• sprout
• thaw
• river
• root

If vow = Summer → bias toward:

• sun
• trail
• stone
• build

If vow = Autumn → bias toward:

• harvest
• dusk
• memory
• grain

The mnemonic becomes a poetic mirror of their chosen identity.

---

# **❄️ 7. Vow Evolution: The Four Phases**

A vow is not static.
It evolves like a living seed.

The Oathroot Engine tracks vow evolution across four phases:

---

## **Phase 1 — The Whisper**

The vow is new, tentative, fragile.
Symbol behavior: faint ember pulse.
Narrative: introspective fragments.

---

## **Phase 2 — The Rooting**

The steward has acted on the vow.
IndexedDB logs threshold met.
Symbol gains branching lines.
Narrative connects action and meaning.

---

## **Phase 3 — The Living Vow**

The vow is part of the steward’s daily rhythm.
Symbol glows steady.
Narrative references stewardship lineage.

---

## **Phase 4 — Oathfire**

Rare state.
Occurs when a steward acts in profound alignment (helping in crisis, planting large quantities, warming a community gathering).
Symbol enters a golden ring phase.
Narrative reveals rare myth fragments of old stewards.

This moment is deeply personal.

---

# **❄️ 8. Vow Resonance with Real-World Actions**

Every action logged in IndexedDB is interpreted through the vow.

For example, if vow = Warmth:

• helping someone → strong resonance
• repairing something → moderate
• planting a seed → small

If vow = Renewal:

• planting → strong
• cleaning a trail → moderate
• sharing food → small

This resonance affects:

• symbol evolution
• narrative weighting
• rare fragment chance
• seasonal behavior

The vow quietly shapes the steward’s journey.

---

# **❄️ 9. Ritual Integration**

Rituals expand vow meaning:

### Ember Rite → amplifies Winter vows

### Seed Rite → amplifies Spring vows

### Feast Rite → amplifies Summer vows

### Memory Rite → amplifies Autumn vows

Each ritual causes the symbol to “thrum” in a seasonal color.

Example:

• Winter vow → symbol pulses blue-white
• Spring vow → green buds form
• Summer vow → gold veins appear
• Autumn vow → copper embers flicker

Rituals breathe life into vows.

---

# **❄️ 10. Narrative Integration**

Fragments respond to vow identity:

• Winter vows unlock lantern and wolf lore
• Spring vows unlock river and sprout lore
• Summer vows unlock builder and wanderer lore
• Autumn vows unlock ancestor and twilight lore

Rare fragments reference vow-specific spirits:

• Winter: Frost Lantern Bearer
• Spring: Thawborn Gardener
• Summer: Sunpath Mason
• Autumn: Ember Archivist

These rare fragments deepen identity.

---

# **❄️ 11. IndexedDB Structure**

The Oathroot Engine stores vow data as:

```
{
  vow_text,
  vow_category,
  vow_phase,
  vow_entropy_root,
  mnemonic_words,
  vow_history: [],
  vow_resonance_map,
  season_alignment,
  rare_vow_events
}
```

Everything is stored locally.
Nothing is uploaded.

---

# **❄️ 12. Zero-Harm Ethics**

Vows must:

• never pressure
• never guilt
• never evaluate worth
• never compare stewards
• never demand consistency
• never punish absence
• never push productivity

The vow system should act as:

• compass
• comfort
• personal arc
• emotional anchor

Not a metric.

The vow is for the steward, not the system.

---

# **❄️ 13. Closing Invocation**

**“A vow is a seed planted in winter.”**

It begins small.
A whisper in the cold.
Then roots dig in.
Then warmth spreads.
Then story grows.
Then identity blooms.

Through the Oathroot Mnemonic Vow Engine, stewards carry ancient words into modern winters — words that warm, words that heal, words that guide.

The vow is the ember.
The steward is the lantern.
The world is the winter.

And together, we walk.
